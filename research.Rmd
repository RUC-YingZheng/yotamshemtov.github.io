### <a href="files/Shemtov_indigent_2018.pdf" target="_blank">Make or Buy? The Provision of Indigent Defense Services in the U.S. </a> 
#### *Submitted*

U.S. courts provide constitutionally mandated legal services to low-income defendants via private court-appointed attorneys and public defendersâ€™ organizations. This paper investigates the relative efficacy of these two modes of indigent defense by comparing outcomes of co-defendants assigned either a public defender or a private court-appointed attorney within the same case. Using data from San Francisco and federal district courts, I find that in multiple defendant cases public defender assignment is plausibly as good as random. Public defenders reduce the probability of any prison sentence by 22% and the length of prison by 10%.

### <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02140" target="_blank">Inference on a New Class of Sample Average Treatment Effects</a>
#### (with <a href="http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Jasjeet S. Sekhon</a>) *R&R at Journal of the American Statistical Association*

We derive new variance formulas for inference on a general class of estimands of causal average treatment effects in a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). We generalize Robins (1988) and show that when the estimand of interest is the Sample Average Treatment Effect of the Treated (SATT or SATC for controls), a consistent variance estimator exists. Although these estimands are equal to the Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) in expectation, potentially large differences in both accuracy and coverage can occur by the change of estimand, even asymptotically. Inference on the SATE, even using a conservative confidence interval, provides incorrect coverage of the SATT or SATC. We derive the variance and limiting distribution of a new and general class of estimands---any mixing between SATT and SATC---for which the SATE is a specific case. We demonstrate the applicability of the new theoretical results using Monte-Carlo simulations and an empirical application with hundreds of online experiments with an average sample size of approximately one hundred million observations per experiment. An R package, estCI, that implements all the proposed estimation procedures is available.

### <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06408" target="_blank">The Classification Permutation Test: A Non-Parametric Test for Equality of Multivariate Distributions</a>
####(with <a href="http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~johanngb/" target="_blank">Johann Gagnon-Bartsch</a>) *R&R at The Annals of Applied Statistics*

The gold standard for identifying causal relationships is a randomized controlled experiment.
In many applications in the social sciences and medicine, the researcher does not control the assignment mechanism and instead may rely upon natural experiments or matching methods as a substitute to experimental randomization. 
The standard testable implication of random assignment is covariate balance between 
the treated and control units.  Covariate balance is therefore commonly used to validate the claim of as good as random assignment. We propose a new nonparametric test of covariate balance.  Our Classification Permutation Test (CPT) is based on a combination of classification methods (e.g. random forests) with Fisherian permutation inference.  The CPT is guaranteed to have correct coverage and is consistent under weak assumptions on the chosen classifier. We revisit four real data examples and present Monte Carlo power simulations to demonstrate the applicability of the CPT relative to other nonparametric tests of equality of multivariate distributions.
